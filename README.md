# Bowling-Game
A simulation class for a bowling game with two endpoints
 - Play(int pins): void
 - GetScore(): int

## Comments and details
I have tried to limit the solution down in complexity, otherwise I would have also added a proper test class and paid more attention to edge cases, and also kept a 
proper git branch tracking and other best development practices.
The rudimentary test I have devised via a console output seems to produce correct output, I have however found the assignment to be a bit
lacking in rules. So for instance my score comes out as 139 whereas the score in the Task input is 133.
This I believe is due to the last spare score for turn no. 21 not doubling, even though technically, according to the requirements, it should.
